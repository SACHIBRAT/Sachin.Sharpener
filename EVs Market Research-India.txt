(A) Key Points:-

. Research suggests the Indian EV market is growing rapidly, with sales reaching about 1.94 million units in 2024, up 26.5% from 1.5 million in 2023.
. It seems likely that two-wheelers dominate, making up 60% of sales, driven by affordability and urban commuting needs.
. The evidence leans toward government policies like FAME II and rising fuel costs as key drivers, though challenges like high costs and limited charging infrastructure persist.
. An unexpected detail is the regional variation, with states like Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu leading, reflecting urban and policy-driven adoption.

(B) Future Outlook:-

The future of EVs in India is promising, with several developments on the horizon:

. Sales Projections:
  By 2030, annual sales could reach 8-10 million units, with EVs comprising 30% of private car sales, as per NITI Aayog and Bain & Company (India Electric Vehicle Report 2023 | Bain & Company).
. Infrastructure Goals:
  India aims for 22,000 charging stations by 2030, with Ather Grid targeting 2,500+ by late 2025, per company announcements.
. Tech Advancements:
  Faster charging (e.g., Ather’s rumored 2-hour 0-80% charger by late 2025) and solid-state batteries by 2027-2028 are expected, enhancing range and convenience.
. New Entrants:
  Tesla’s Mumbai showroom (2025) and VinFast’s local production plans will intensify competition, while Ather’s Zenith (electric bike) and EL (budget scooter) platforms are set for 2026, per IPO filings.

(C) Conclusion
The Indian EV market is poised for significant expansion, driven by policy support, consumer shifts, and technological advancements.
While challenges like infrastructure and cost persist, the trajectory suggests a transformative impact on mobility by 2030, with two-wheelers leading and passenger cars gaining ground.
Regional variations and new entrants will shape the competitive landscape, necessitating strategic investments in charging and manufacturing.
